<h2>Problem Statement üìù</h2>
<h3>Online Video KYC</h3>
Currently Know Your Customer (KYC) is largely an offline and manual process OR non-interactive online process. Create an online interactive process to do video KYC which is intuitive and self-sufficient. KYC should capture the user‚Äôs live photograph and their basic details like name, DOB, address, pan card / Aadhaar, signature, income range, type of employment in a conversational manner. This tool should be highly inclusive and should have high reach across languages and generations irrespective of financial and education gap.

<h2>Our Aim üéØ</h2>
The primary goal is to establish a groundbreaking standard for an online interactive video KYC process accessible to all individuals, regardless of their financial status or educational background.


<h2>User Flow üö©</h2>

Create an intuitive and user-friendly online KYC platform with the following features:


*   Upon visiting the homepage, a pop-up language selection option will appear.
*   Once a language is selected, a language card will be displayed, providing instructions in the chosen language.
*   ‚Å†Users will be prompted to provide their information, including capturing live photographs, Aadhaar card images (front and back), and signatures using a pen or paper.
*   After granting camera access, users will navigate through screens where they'll be prompted to perform facial movements and display their Aadhaar card for verification.
*   ‚Å†Instructions and visual aids will guide users on how to properly position and capture their Aadhaar card.
*   A pop-up will verify the captured details against the Aadhaar image.
*   The process will then proceed to capture the user's signature, following the same steps as before.
*   Users will then be directed to separate screens to answer questions related to employment type and salary range.
